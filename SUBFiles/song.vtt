00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.440
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.220
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.480
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.500
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.020
I walk alone
I walk alone

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.140
I walk alone
I walk a...

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.100
My shadow's the only one that walks beside
me

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.540
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.400
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.940
'Til then I walk alone

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:51.240
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.520
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.440
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.840
Read between the lines
Of what's fucked up and everything's alright

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.980
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.900
I walk alone
I walk alone

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.000
I walk alone
I walk a...

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.400
My shadow's the only one that walks beside
me

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.580
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.900
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

'Til then I walk alone

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.520
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.000
I walk alone
