INSTRUMENTATION
Where the city sleeps
On The Boulevard of Broken Dreams
And I'm the only one and I walk a...
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
I'm walking down the line
I walk a...
me
The only one that I have ever known
Read between the lines
I walk alone
I walk this empty street
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah

Of what's fucked up and everything's alright
But it's home to me and I walk alone
That divides me somewhere in my mind
Language: en
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
Check my vital signs
Kind: captions
On the border line
Ah-ah, ah-ah
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
My shadow's the only one that walks beside
'Til then I walk alone
I walk a lonely road
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Don't know where it goes
WEBVTT
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone
